# ISC2-Introduction to NIST Cybersecury Framework Training

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 
It is a Framework; it is a tool to help everyone understand security threatsCSF is used for implementing security process, policies, and procedures addressing risk![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45578248/194077240-68cf2d58-9932-4dc6-ab93-cd4beb766d51.png)

### History of NIST
Originally founded by the United States Congress on March 3, 1901, the mission of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is promoting innovation and industrial competitiveness, NIST focuses on a wide range of topics including advanced communications, advanced manufacturing, forensics, health and bioscience, and cybersecurity.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45578248/194077581-bda43872-d936-4684-8d02-b3f71aed09d1.png)

NIST enables standardized commerce across the us and across continents. NIST has been instrumental in the development of neon lights, railroad track gauge, electrical safety, digital imaging, and data encryption standards![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45578248/194077675-9967a159-4f5e-47a4-87c4-12f42730893d.png)

### Executive Order 13636 (policy to enhance security)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45578248/194077790-918b431c-568f-4710-86d7-00b218f97ae6.png)
It is the policy of the US to enhance the security of the nationâ€™s critical infrastructure.A Framework for reducing risks to critical infrastructureSharing cybersecurity threat informationMaintain a cyber-environment for safety, security and privacy.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45578248/194077930-c17a9443-3757-46b0-9a30-0f48f2e74df2.png)

Shortly thereafter, NIST released a series of requests for information (RFIs) to collect information on what standards industry was currently using and to create industry awareness of the forthcoming endeavor![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45578248/194078011-00ff9386-5de2-4410-b892-8884baa01ef1.png)

From the beginning in 2013 the latest revision in 2018, the CSF has been developed with the input form government, industry and individuals![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45578248/194078094-455be2ff-cb35-4780-a533-70be888cf73b.png)

### Framework Components
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework consists of thre main components:
- Framework Core
- Implementation Tiers
- Profiles
